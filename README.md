# DSA Detection System
**`DSA Detection System`** is a Machine Learning and IOT-based car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy and under the influence of alcohol. DSA stands for Drowsiness, Smoke and Alcohol Detection Systems which is the technology used in car accident prevention.

Here is a detailed description of this project:

*  **`Driver Drowsiness Detection System`** can use cameras, eye tracking sensors, and other hardware to monitor visual cues, where drowsiness can be detected through yawning frequency, eye-blinking frequency, eye-gaze movement, head movement, and facial expressions.[Read More](https://github.com/Code-blogger/DSA_Dectection_System/tree/master/Drowsiness%20detection)
* The main unit of this project is an **`Alcohol Detection System`**. If the person inside the car has consumed alcohol then it is alcohol detection is done by the sensor. The sensor gives this signal through a buzzer or alarm. [Read More](https://github.com/Code-blogger/DSA_Dectection_System/tree/master/Alcohol%20Detection)
*  **`Smoke Detection System`** is a fire protection device that automatically detects the smoke by sensing it and gives us a warning while driving. Smoke detecting in this project is worked on the detection of smoke by using an MQ2 sensor device.[Read More](https://github.com/Code-blogger/DSA_Dectection_System/tree/master/Smoke%20Detection)

## Usefulness:
Very useful for preventing the lives of so many people. This detection system can alert the driver getting drowsy and consuming a high amount of alcohol which helps to prevent the chances of an accident. Smoke detection is an additional safety tool for this project.
