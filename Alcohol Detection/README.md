# Alcohol Detection System
**“Alcohol sensor** is the main part of the Alcohol Detection System. If the person inside the car has consumed alcohol then it is alcohol detection is done by the sensor. The sensor gives this signal through a buzzer or alarm.

> Submodules for the Alcohol detection system are as follows-
* Module 1 – Alcohol Sensor.
* Module 2 – Raising alarm/glow LED.

The functionality of each module is as follows:
* _Alcohol Sensor_ - If the person inside the car has consumed alcohol then it is alcohol detection is done by the sensor. The sensor gives this signal to a comparator IC. The output of the comparator is connected to the microcontroller.
* _Raising alarm/glow LED_ – As the system detects that the person in the vehicle is consuming alcohol it will raise the alarm and glow LED.

#### Hardware Interface:
* Arduino UNO
* MQ-3 Sensor
* Buzzer
