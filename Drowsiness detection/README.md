#Driver Drowsiness Detection
**Driver drowsiness detection** systems can use cameras, eye-tracking sensors, and other hardware to monitor visual cues, where drowsiness can be detected through yawning frequency, eye-blinking frequency, eye-gaze movement, head movement, and facial expressions.

> Submodules for the Drowsiness detection system are as follows-
* Module 1 - Recording driver’s behavior.
* Module 2 - Continuous evaluation of driver’s facial features.
* Module 3 - Raising an alarm.

The functionality of each module is as follows:
* _Recording driver’s behavior_- The moment the trip begins, the camera will start and drowsiness can be detected through yawning frequency, eye-blinking frequency, eye-gaze movement, head movement, and facial expressions.
* _Continuous evaluation of driver’s facial features_- Driver drowsiness detection systems can use cameras, eye-tracking sensors, and other hardware to monitor visual cues.
* _Raising an alarm_–As the System detects the driver is feeling drowsy alarm will be raised.
