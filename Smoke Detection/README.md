# Smoke Detection System
The **Smoke Detector** is a fire protection device that automatically detects the smoke by sensing and gives us a warning while driving. Smoke detecting in this project is worked on the detection of smoke by using an MQ2 sensor device.

> Submodules for the Smoke detection system are as follows-
* Module 1 – Smoke detector.
* Module 2 – Raising Alarm.

The functionality of each module is as follows:
* _Smoke detector_ – The other type of commonly used detection technology is called photoelectric. This technology works by detecting light that is reflected off particles from a light beam inside the sensing chamber. When no particles are present in the sensing chamber, the light from the beam does not strike the light detector, indicating all is clear.
* _Raising Alarm_ - When there are particles present and the amount of light registered by the light detector reaches a certain threshold level, the alarm sounds.

#### Hardware Interface:
* Arduino UNO
* MQ-2 Sensor
* Buzzer
* LED
* Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* Cable
* Personal Computer (min. 8 GB RAM, i3 Processor)

#### Software Interface:
* Arduino software
* OS (Windows or Ubuntu)
